# equinix_metal_virtual_circuit (Resource)





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `connection_id` (String) UUID of Connection where the VC is scoped to
- `port_id` (String) UUID of the Connection Port where the VC is scoped to
- `project_id` (String) UUID of the Project where the VC is scoped to

### Optional

- `customer_ip` (String) The Customer IP address which the CSR switch will peer with. Will default to the other usable IP in the subnet.
- `description` (String) Description of the Virtual Circuit resource
- `md5` (String, Sensitive) The password that can be set for the VRF BGP peer
- `metal_ip` (String) The Metal IP address for the SVI (Switch Virtual Interface) of the VirtualCircuit. Will default to the first usable IP in the subnet.
- `name` (String) Name of the Virtual Circuit resource
- `nni_vlan` (Number) Equinix Metal network-to-network VLAN ID (optional when the connection has mode=tunnel)
- `peer_asn` (Number) The BGP ASN of the peer. The same ASN may be the used across several VCs, but it cannot be the same as the local_asn of the VRF.
- `speed` (String) Description of the Virtual Circuit speed. This is for information purposes and is computed when the connection type is shared.
- `subnet` (String) A subnet from one of the IP blocks associated with the VRF that we will help create an IP reservation for. Can only be either a /30 or /31.
				 * For a /31 block, it will only have two IP addresses, which will be used for the metal_ip and customer_ip.
				 * For a /30 block, it will have four IP addresses, but the first and last IP addresses are not usable. We will default to the first usable IP address for the metal_ip.
- `tags` (List of String) Tags attached to the virtual circuit
- `vlan_id` (String) UUID of the VLAN to associate
- `vrf_id` (String) UUID of the VRF to associate

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `nni_vnid` (Number) Nni VLAN ID parameter, see https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/networking/fabric/
- `status` (String) Status of the virtual circuit resource
- `vnid` (Number) VNID VLAN parameter, see https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/networking/fabric/
