# equinix_metal_virtual_circuit (Data Source)





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `virtual_circuit_id` (String) ID of the virtual circuit to lookup

### Read-Only

- `connection_id` (String) UUID of Connection where the VC is scoped to
- `customer_ip` (String) The Customer IP address which the CSR switch will peer with. Will default to the other usable IP in the subnet.
- `description` (String) Description of the virtual circuit
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `md5` (String, Sensitive) The password that can be set for the VRF BGP peer
- `metal_ip` (String) The Metal IP address for the SVI (Switch Virtual Interface) of the VirtualCircuit. Will default to the first usable IP in the subnet.
- `name` (String) Name of the virtual circuit
- `nni_vlan` (Number) Nni VLAN parameter, see https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/networking/fabric/
- `nni_vnid` (Number) Nni VLAN ID parameter, see https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/networking/fabric/
- `peer_asn` (Number) The BGP ASN of the peer. The same ASN may be the used across several VCs, but it cannot be the same as the local_asn of the VRF.
- `port_id` (String) UUID of the Connection Port where the VC is scoped to
- `project_id` (String) ID of the projct to which the virtual circuit belongs
- `speed` (String) Description of the Virtual Circuit speed. This is for information purposes and is computed when the connection type is shared.
- `status` (String) Status of the virtual circuit
- `subnet` (String) A subnet from one of the IP blocks associated with the VRF that we will help create an IP reservation for. Can only be either a /30 or /31.
				 * For a /31 block, it will only have two IP addresses, which will be used for the metal_ip and customer_ip.
				 * For a /30 block, it will have four IP addresses, but the first and last IP addresses are not usable. We will default to the first usable IP address for the metal_ip.
- `tags` (List of String) Tags attached to the virtual circuit
- `vlan_id` (String) UUID of the associated VLAN
- `vnid` (Number) VNID VLAN parameter, see https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/networking/fabric/
- `vrf_id` (String) UUID of the associated VRF
